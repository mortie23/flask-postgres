# Flask app connected to PostGres on remote machine

## Background

We are building out an application that has a decoupled RDBMS from a Front end in a multi cloud environment. We want the front end to be containerised.

![](./img/architecture.png)

The choice atchitecture for this demonstration will be:

1. A self managed Postgres database on one cloud platform (GCP)
1. A self managed web server on a different cloud platform (AWS)
1. A local Windows client development environment

## The Postgres Database (IaaS)

In this example I will be using a self managed Postgres database on a compute engine (Infrastructure as a Service). The main reason for this was that I already had this setup. It is a cheap way of testing out architectures. However, using a PaaS Postgres offering through something like these would be beneficial for a production solution as won't need the overhead of managing upgrades and patching of the server OS:

- AWS RDS [https://aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)
- GCP Cloud SQL [https://cloud.google.com/sql](https://cloud.google.com/sql)
- Azure Database [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/postgresql/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/postgresql/)

### Firewall

To get started with local development, we need to add a firewall rule such that our client machine can connect to the remote Postgres service running on the GCP cloud compute service.

In the GCP console, we create a new firewall rule.

![](./img/gcp-vpc-firewall-create.png)

In this example we name it _postgres_ and the protocol/port is `tcp:5432` (the default port for Postgres). The Target (tag) will be the tag we have used for the Compute engine.

![](./img/gcp-vpc-firewall-postgres.png)

Then, after finding out what our public IP address is (you can just ask Google _what is my ip address_) we allow our IP address through the firewall.

![](./img/gcp-vpc-firewall-postgres-tag-ip.png)

You will notice there is a second IP address allowed through the firewall. This is the web server machine's IP address which will be discussed later in the blog post.

## Local development environment

I am using a Windows machine with:

- WSL 2 (Ubuntu 20.04)
- Python 3.8.10

![](./img/machine-windows-wsl.png)

To get started there is an OS dependency we need to install:

```sh
sudo apt install libpq-dev
```

Now we will create a Python virtual environment for the development.

```sh
cd ~/venv
python3 -m venv fpg
source fpg/bin/activate
```

### Clone the git repository

The Github repository to follow is [https://github.com/mortie23/flask-postgres](https://github.com/mortie23/flask-postgres).

### Create a `.env` in the root of the repository

```ini
APP_SETTINGS=config.Config
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<database>"
```

## Initiate the database

If you have configured everything else correctly, and have the correct connection string in your `.env` file, you should be able to initialise the database.

```sh
flask db init
```

```log
  Creating directory /flask-postgres/migrations ...  done
  Creating directory /flask-postgres/migrations/versions ...  done
  Generating /flask-postgres/migrations/script.py.mako ...  done
  Generating /flask-postgres/migrations/env.py ...  done
  Generating /flask-postgres/migrations/alembic.ini ...  done
  Generating /flask-postgres/migrations/README ...  done
  Please edit configuration/connection/logging settings in '/flask-postgres/migrations/alembic.ini' before proceeding.
```

```sh
flask db migrate
```

```log
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl PostgresqlImpl.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume transactional DDL.
INFO  [alembic.autogenerate.compare] Detected added table 'todo'
  Generating /flask-postgres/migrations/versions/bc12dad5cf64_.py ...  done
```

```sh
flask db upgrade
```

```log
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl PostgresqlImpl.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume transactional DDL.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade 812916de9ad7 -> bc12dad5cf64, empty message
```

## Run the Flask application in development

```sh
python3 app.py
```

```log

### Test the appliction works

With a sample item in the todo, we can test that the appliction is writing to the cloud IaaS Postgres instance.

## Deploy the application

### Create a docker image of the Flask application

```sh
docker build -t mortimerxyz/flaskpostgrestodo:0.1 .
```

```log

To see the built image:

```sh
docker images -a
```

```log
REPOSITORY                      TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED             SIZE
mortimerxyz/flaskpostgrestodo   0.1       bd1fffc6a115   About an hour ago   986MB
```

This run statement passes the host machines environment variables for `APP_SETTINGS` and `DATABASE_URL` to the running Docker container.
This means that to get it running, you will not be able to depend on the `.env` file you have for development.
Since I am using a Windows host, the following PowerShell commands need to run to set the environment variables:

```ps1
$Env:APP_SETTINGS='config.Config'
$Env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<database>"
```

```sh
docker run --env APP_SETTINGS --env DATABASE_URL -p 5000:5000 mortimerxyz/flaskpostgrestodo:0.1
```

```log

```

### Stop the running container

```sh
docker ps
```

```log
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                               COMMAND                  CREATED
STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES
fd611c4ff1ff   mortimerxyz/flaskpostgrestodo:0.1   "gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0â€¦"   6 minutes ago   Up 6 minutes   0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp   nice_mclaren
```

```sh
docker stop fd611c4ff1ff
```

### Publish the image to a container registry

We now need to push the image to a container registry so we can pull it from our deployment service.

```sh
docker push mortimerxyz/flaskpostgrestodo:0.1
```

![](./img/dockerhub-publish-image.png)

### Use the Docker image to deploy application

We are going to use a basic EC2 machine to host the web application.
To enable us to SSH to the machine we will need to add a firewall rule to allow SSH over port 22 to our public IP address:  
![](./img/aws-ec2-sgr-localip.png)

We will also need to add the public IP address of the EC2 machine to the firewall for the GCP machine that is hosting the Postgres database service:

![](./img/aws-ec2-public-ip.png)

First we will start with pulling the Docker image down from where we published it to Docker hub.

```sh
docker pull mortimerxyz/flaskpostgrestodo:0.1
```

```log

Status: Downloaded newer image for mortimerxyz/flaskpostgrestodo:0.1
docker.io/mortimerxyz/flaskpostgrestodo:0.1
```

Since we are now using a Linux host, the following Bash commands need to run to set the environment variables:

```sh
export APP_SETTINGS=config.Config
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<database>"
```

We need to run the Docker container in detached mode:

```sh
docker run --detach --env APP_SETTINGS --env DATABASE_URL -p 5000:5000 mortimerxyz/flaskpostgrestodo:0.1
```

This EC2 machine already has Nginx installed and an associated SSL certificate and a domain name (this is outside the scope of this blog post).

We need to configure a server rule to proxy pass the service running on port 5000 to the SSL port 443 in the default Nginx configuration file (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`).

```conf
location / {
  proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
  proxy_redirect http://localhost:5000/ $scheme://$http_host/;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
  proxy_read_timeout 20d;
}
```

Now when we browse to the domain name we get the running Flask application.
